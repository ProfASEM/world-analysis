# Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow starting from collecting data, cleaning it using Python and Pandas, performing exploratory and descriptive analysis, and preparing the final visualization dashboard using Power BI. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear, accessible way.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Load and explore data from multiple sources.
* Clean and preprocess the datasets (handle missing values, fix data types, remove duplicates).
* Perform descriptive statistics to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
* Use Python, Pandas, and SQL for data preparation.
* Integrate results into Power BI for visualization.
* Produce insights that support decision-making.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **SQL** (for data extraction and transformation)
* **Web Scraping** (if applicable)
* **Power BI** (for dashboard creation)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* **notebooks/** – Jupyter Notebook containing cleaning, transformation, and analysis steps.
* **data/** – Raw and cleaned datasets.
* **dashboard/** – Power BI report files and visualizations.
* **README.md** – Documentation of the whole project.

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Steps

* Checking for missing values.
* Filling or removing missing data depending on context.
* Correcting inconsistent formatting.
* Combining data from different sources.
* Validating the final cleaned dataset.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

* Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
* Distribution analysis.
* Correlation analysis between important variables.
* Identifying outliers and anomalies.

> **Note:** Charts and visualizations are implemented in **Power BI**.

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

* Key metrics and KPIs.
* Trend and comparison charts.
* Visual correlations.
* Insights summary.

Screenshots or the `.pbix` file can be found in the `dashboard/` folder.

## 💡 Key Insights

* (Add your specific insights here based on your real analysis.)
* Example: "Variable A strongly correlates with Variable B, indicating..."
* Example: "The highest values occur during... which suggests..."

---

## ⚙️ Challenges & How They Were Solved

* Missing or inconsistent data → handled using statistical methods.
* Combining multiple datasets → resolved using joins and key alignment.
* Web scraping issues → fixed by adjusting headers and request handling.
